Perform one-hot encoding on categorical data to analyze which feature values have a significant impact on label values. Group labels for statistical analysis, compare the mean values after grouping 0/1 labels, and preliminarily screen features that have a significant impact on labels to form x and y. Train the model through cross-validation, grid search, and other methods. Finally, calculate using the Roc_AUC metric and evaluate the model's accuracy
